# brain-seizure-detection
EEG signals time series classification using Gated recurrent unit neural network.

This project is heavily commented and explained almost line by line.

the goal is to detect epileptic seizure based on EEG signals that captures brain activity through time.

the type of Neural network used is recurrent GRU.
Gated recurrent units are a gating mechanism in recurrent neural networks, introduced in 2014 by Kyunghyun Cho et al.
The GRU is like a long short-term memory with a forget gate, but has fewer parameters than LSTM and less complex than LSTM.



electroencephalogram (EEG) is a test that detects electrical activity in your brain using small, metal discs (electrodes) attached to your scalp. 
Your brain cells communicate via electrical impulses and are active all the time, even when you're asleep.
This activity shows up as wavy lines on an EEG recording
